## GIF BATTLE Discord Bot



Idea:

A GIF Battle Round starts when someone posts a GIF
Everyone jumps in and battles with GIFs
If the channel is quiet for 4 hours, the battle round ends (4 hours is an example)
The last person to post a GIF wins the round

A new battle round begins the next time someone posts a GIF.

This would be a more fair for users in other time zones.


Rule of thumb:
If your GIF is the last one standing before the channel naps for 4 hours… you win.


Points:

Win a GIF Battle Round
→ +10 Chaos Points

Join the Battle (post at least 1 GIF in the round)
→ +2 Chaos Points

Crowd Favorite Bonus
→ If your GIF gets lots of reactions ( reacting to your own does not count)
→ +1 point per reaction (max +5)

Streak Bonus
→ Win 2 rounds in a row = +5 bonus points


Roles & Bragging Rights

GIF Battle Champ
→ Awarded to the most recent winner
→ Held until the next round ends

Chaos Legend

→ Pure bragging rights



## Notes

Bot prompts the user to start a new battle round if the last battle round was more than 4 hours ago.
Gives the user options. 

Chaos points can be used to purchase abilities.
 * Having the bot notify all participants of the battle. before the round ends. (MESSY)
